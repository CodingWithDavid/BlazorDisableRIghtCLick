## Why

I have needed this functionality in the past and I always need to do research to figure out how to implement it

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorDisableRIghtCLick
   cd BlazorDisableRIghtCLick
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template.  I have added the javascript code to disable the browser context menu.  I added code to the Counter to show how to handle a right click within the Blazor page.

This shows how to provide a visual feedback to the user on a long running process.  The actual UI of the spinner can be any CSS styled spinner.
